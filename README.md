# Scott Borlon | Junior web dev

I'm a junior websites crafter, bugs hunter, and occasionally Googling 'how to center a div.' Let's just say my best friend is Ctrl+Z!

## My three surprising skills are: 
* Regex cry-baby: can't read nor write regular expressions without crying
* searching detective: mastering google is inevitable in a web developer journey
* time-unexpert: master in the "5 more minutes" field

## The three things I like the most in the universe:
* Dr. Who
* Internet
* My family

## The objectives I want to achieve as a developer during BeCode: 

I'm looking to become a full stack developer using mainly Javascript and being able to setup a whole website except the design part.

## The fears I might have:

Not being able to achieve my goal in a 7 month period.

## The things I look forward to: 

Tech money and free society car.

## The three things I value the most in working as a team:

* Diversity of ideas.
* Shared productivity.
* The support it can give.
